## Description ##
  Tone&Stimulus is a control system for a neuroscience behavior research. It consists of two pack of programs:
  - one for PC, to contol Arduino and create GUI
  - other one for Arduino UNO, to guide the experiment.
  
  The system made for controling a specific experiment which is a Pavlovian conditioning of two stimuli: a conditioned stimulus (CS, e.g. tone) and after that an unconditioned stmulus (UC, e.g. waterdrop, air puff). The experiment states out of trials: a pair of CS and UC stimulus.
  Trail has parameters, they are variable in run time:
  * number of trials (*nT*)
  * tone frequency (freq. for: Reward *FR*, Air Puff *FA*, Tail Shock *FT*, Empty *FE*)
  * tone length (*TL*)
  * gap length between tone and the stimulus (*GL*)
  * stimulus length (one by one: *RL*, *AL*, *TL*, *EL*)
  * duration between two trials: base (*iT*)
  * duration between two trials: random diffusion factor (*dif*)
  
  The program chooses from the selected stimuli randomly, however, every stimulus will be used the same times in an experiment or training session
  - [x] the numbers of stimuli are equal
  - [ ] nT by stimuli
  
  In the *History* part of the main window and a file in the *Diary* folder, users can easily check the changes along the session. In the *Display* modul numbers of the left trials by stimuli visible.
  - [ ] *Display* modul
  
## Installing ##
  In the first place, the system requires one Arduino UNO board and one PC with an USB A-B cable.
  To programing the board and run the Python code you will need the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/) to be installed on the PC with some additional libaries.
  See the necessary libraries below.

  #### Used libraries ####
   * Arduino: [SoftTimers.h](https://github.com/end2endzone/SoftTimers)
   * Python: [pyserial 3.4](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/), [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
   - [ ] Arduino parameters and functions into library
   - [ ] add KEYWORDS.txt too
  
  Maybe there are some plus files in the repository whitch not required. They just halp in the development. The essential files are below.
  
  #### Essential files ####
   * arduino: the whole [ToneStimTrial04](/arduino/ToneStimeTrial04) folder (open with IDE and upload to Arduino)
   * Python: [CommunicationProtocol.py](/python/CommunicationProtocol.py), [GlobalParameters.py](/pythonGlobalParameters.py), [GUI_.py](/python/GUI_.py), [ToneStim04.py](/python/ToneStim04.py) (in the same folder)
